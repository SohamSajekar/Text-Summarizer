# Text-Summarizer
Extractive text summarizer based sentence scoring algorithms.

Through this project, we plan to address two of the challenging tasks in computational
linguistics namely text summarization and paraphrasing, together. The task of identifying the
most important parts of a long piece of text which preserves the key ideas and overall meaning,
and rephrasing these texts for better understanding has been a difficult task not just for
computers but also for humans. The main motivation behind this project is to come up with a
computationally less intensive methodology using statistical and linguistic techniques to
produce the best-rephrased summary of the text for applications with less accessibility to heavy
computation.

The main goals of this project are to create an extractive text summarizer that will condense a
given text by extracting important sentences that can be represented as a summary for the
input text, as well as a paraphrase generator that will rewrite the summarized sentences to
produce a unique summary of the input text.

For this project, we will be using CNN-Daily Mail dataset. It consists of 300,000 unique news
articles from CNN and the Daily Mail in the English language, along with the summaries for
every article. The dataset is divided into 287,226 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs and
11,490 test pairs. This is a well-known dataset that is used to build both extractive and
abstractive text summarization models.
